# Xolth
Xol  toolhead mod that lowers center of mass so the center is on the same plane as the rail. Uses the short ducts.

# Required components:
MGN9,
6mm belts,
Dragon UHF,
Klicky PCB,
CNC XY joints (for clearance of the lower motor spacer),
Sensorless,
VZ Hextrudort Low,
Afterburner PCB (for now),

# Important
Make sure you put the belts in the clip and push them in from the sides all the way in while screwing the screw from above.
Make sure you press the belt in at the same time so it doesn't slide out. Do this with caution, you will destroy your clips 
and the belt if not done properly.Test fit all peces once off the printer so the screws can condition the holes. You have to 
unscrew the front idlers fully to allow for this.
